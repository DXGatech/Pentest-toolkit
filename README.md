# Pentest-toolkit
A penetration testing toolkit based on metasploit and some other minor libs.

#VenomAutomation
An easy-to-use trojan generator specially designed for OSX penetration based on metasploit. While it also supports trojans against other major platforms, the default OSX generator is recommended, as it has been tested by the major virus-detection engines and is proved to be competent.

```
#To use the shell script:
./AutomatedTrojanGen.sh
#To clean up the intermediate files that are generated for trojan construction:
./clean_up.sh
```
